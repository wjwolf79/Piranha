# Welcome to Piranha CMS

Piranha CMS is a **lightweight** framework for building content driven applications using ASP.NET MVC & Web Pages. The main focus of the framework lies in structuring and managing content, not in providing a pre packaged web interface. 

Piranha CMS can be used to build a new application from scratch, or to add CMS functionality to an already existing application.

There are NuGet packages available for both the template projects, as well as for the core libraries. To read more about how to get started and the different packages available you can find more information in the Wiki section at:
